# Problem Solving Techniques for programming

Problem Solving is the most important skill to have as a software engineer or programmer.  

## 1. Understand the problem

    a. Read or listen to the problem

    b. repeat the problem

    c. Ask clarifying questions

    d. break it down into smaller problems as much 
    as possible - never assume, just ask
    
    e. identify constraints or edge cases
## 2. Develop an algorithm to solve it

    a. whiteboard - visualize thought process

    b. diagram it out

    c. write out a case or example

    d. walk through it slowly

    e. always good idea to take some input & just figure out what output should be

    f. walk through algorithm development visually on board

    g. break down action steps & reasoning - all aloud

    h. verbalize potential solutions - to demonstrate how you plan to solve the problem & address edge cases or issues you might run into while solving

    i. simplify & test or verify: write it out & address any other issues to add to your code solutions as you plan it out before you code it

## 3. Code the solution

    a. identify functions, variables, input & output, etc.

    b. identify potential errors

    c. verbalize & test alternative solutions

    d. run code to ensure it works

    e. explain your solution & reasoning (summarize)
