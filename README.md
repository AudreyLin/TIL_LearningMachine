Today I Learned (TIL) 

This is a collection of concise write-ups on small technological and software engineering related things that I learned or worked on for the day.  Said things don't really warrant a full blog post.  

Also, some of these will be a review or refresh of information since I've been working on learning software engineering for a long time, but I am just starting this repo and have done other learning and college degrees before this repo that will not be documented here. 

## Tutorial Tracking Entries
Some of these entries will mark my progress and some notes about where I've left off to track my progress.  

- Make this a habit
    - Limit posts to 200 words or less - keep it focused
    - keep it within 10-15 minutes daily
    - do it as you're doing your work - use smart notes
- Use [Smart Notes](https://docdrop.org/download_annotation_doc/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes-by-So%CC%88nke-Ahrens-40zol.pdf)
