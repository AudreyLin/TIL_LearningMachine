Storytelling is an important aspect of technical writing to keep your content relatable & interesting.  Take your audience on a journey of your project or whatever topic you're covering.  

Write about your challenges and the solutions or results, and lessons learned.  Take your audience through that experience and thought process.  

Also consider:
